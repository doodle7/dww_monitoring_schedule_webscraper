making pyinstaller work:

Error 1:
first got an error saying fsspec pandas optional dependency was not loaded into the exe.  I added it as an import statement in the .py file,
then I also added it as a flag in comandline keyword argument --hidden-input=fsspec



Error 2:
requests get statement was not working properly, because it where it was looking it couldn't find the cacert.pem file.  Which is important
for certificate vertification.  I included the below code, in my file and it worked.
  
def override_where():
    """ overrides certifi.core.where to return actual location of cacert.pem"""
    # change this to match the location of cacert.pem
    return os.path.abspath("C:\\Users\\seanm\\.conda\\envs\\mplleaflet\\Lib\\site-packages\\certifi\\cacert.pem")
#is the program compiled?

if hasattr(sys, "frozen"):
    import certifi.core

    os.environ["REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE"] = override_where()
    certifi.core.where = override_where

    # delay importing until after where() has been replaced
    import requests.utils
    import requests.adapters
    # replace these variables in case these modules were
    # imported before we replaced certifi.core.where
    requests.utils.DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH = override_where()
    requests.adapters.DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH = override_where()
