# dww_monitoring_schedule_webscraper

This webscraper was designed for public water systems to be able to detect changes in the NJ drinking water watch (dww) website.  
Since there is currently no API for this website, current public water systems need to manually track changes by checking the website periodically.  
Automatically detecting changes in dww can be extremely beneficial to companies who oversee many public water systems which have changing monitoring schedules.
